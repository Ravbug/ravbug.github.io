    <h4>"Three Kingdoms Minecraft"</h4>
    <p>
        Inspired by <a target="_blank"
            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PhoenixSC/comments/cnbe4l/google_translate_minecraft/">DutChen18</a>,
        I created two Google Translate resource packs for Minecraft Java Edition 1.14. All text in the game has been translated,
        including the splash texts, the end poem, and the game's credits.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are two packs available: a 10x translation and a 30x translation. 
    </p>
    <p>
        To get around Google's IP tempban (which they impose if you spam the translation URL too much), I created a
        Google Spreadsheet which performs the translations using the <code>GOOGLETRANSLATE()</code> call. Then, I
        wrote a program which takes the JSON langauge file and converts it to a CSV. I pasted
        the CSV's cells into the spreadsheet and waited until the next day. After downloading the results as a CSV, 
        I wrote a second program to convert the CSV back to JSON. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Unlike DutChen18 I didn't think to pre-process the <code>%s</code> / <code>%1$s</code> special tokens in the
        language file before dumping as a CSV, so I had to fix those manually. If anything is broken, 
        please tell me (comment on the <a href=a>reddit thread</a>) so I can fix it.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you want to mess around with translation telephone, I made a webpage which lets you do that easily. 
        You can visit it here: <a href="../hypertranslate/">Hypertranslate</a>. Note that if you use this too much
        Google will temporarily block your IP (since it runs clientside) and it will stop working. 
    </p>
    <h4>How to use</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the .zip files inside <code>minecraft/resourcepacks</code> and extract them.</li>
            <li>Open Minecraft, select Options > Resource Packs, and enable the resource pack you want to use.</li>
            <li>Return to the Options menu, select Language, then find Google Translate in the list and select it.</li>
            <li>Return to the menu. The text should be changed.</li>
