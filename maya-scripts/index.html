    <strong>Here are a bunch of Maya scripts that I wrote that I am releasing to the public. They are confirmed to work
        in Maya 2016 or later.</strong>

    If you find issues with any of the scripts, tweet the issue at me (@ravbug).

    <h2>N-Gon detector for Maya</h2>
    - Language: MEL
    <p>This simple program scans any polygonal object and finds any N-Gons (or ngons). An N-gon is a polygon face that
        has more vertices than 4 (or 3 if your program doesn't accept quads).

        To use, select any object or set of objects, launch the script, and press [Run]. You have the option of having
        the program consider quads or tris (or both) to be N-Gons.

        The program will select all the N-Gons and report how many it found. With the N-Gons selected, you can delete
        them, or assign them a material, or put them in a display layer, etc.</p>

    <h2>Hidden Object Locator</h2>
    Language: Python
    <p>This program analyzes the camera view and animation and finds objects that are always outside the camera's view.
        It can also find objects that are always obscured by other objects. It selects these objects, so you can delete
        them or put them on a display layer or what have you.

        To use, Go into a single-panel layout that shows the view you want to scan. Then deselect everything and

        You can also use this script to check an object's geometry to see if there are any faces the camera never sees.
        Running this script this on environment geometry and then deleting the found faces can greatly improve render
        times. Make sure to go into isolate select and then go into component mode if you decide to do this.

        Objects whose LOD is set to Template or Reference will confuse the script. Set all objects to a LOD of Normal.
        Otherwise the script will flag them as being "invisible."</p>

    Usage Examples:
    <article>
        <div>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/3PXya7h.png" /><br>
            The red pipe is selected because it is outside of camera1's view for the entirety of the 120 frames.
        </div>
        <div>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/JUxfeuD.png" /><br>
            Here, the red pipe is not selected because it originated inside the camera view but exited. Because
            it was once in the camera view, it was not flagged as hidden. (See motion trail)
        </div>
        <div>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/350XsX0.png" /><br>
            With Occlusion Search turned off, the green pipe is not selected even though the purple plane is
            completely blocking it form camera1's view. The red pipe was selected because it remained outside
            camera1's view.
        </div>
        <div>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/zUUn811.png" /><br>
            However, with Occlusion Search enabled, the green pipe is selected because camera1 cannot see it,
            even though it is 100% inside camera1's frustum. Occlusion Search is disabled by default because
            sometimes objects such as lights and shadow casting objects are hidden behind other objects but are
            critical to the look of a scene.

    <h2>Auto Keyframe Camera Shake Generator</h2>
    Language: MEL
    <p>This simple utility adds customizable jitter to a camera (or any object with translate / rotate channels). Select
        the objects, launch the script, and press [Shake!].</p>

    <h2>Quad Sphere generator</h2>
    Language: Python
    <p>
        Creates a sphere that has no triangles or poles (vertex with many edges leading to it).
        Note: The sphere isn't perfect, so if you have a way to fix the shape, please let me know.

    <h2>Batch Attribute Connector</h2>
    Language: MEL
    <p>
        Bulk direct-connects a set of objects to a master object. Useful for easiliy setting up direct-drive for a
        controller, Rig-wide node caching or Rig-wide evalulation disabling

        Very simple, so just copy-paste the code into the script editor.
    </p>
