    <h1>Legacy Cleverbug Source Code</h1>

    I decided to partially open-source the legacy Cleverbug code. You can find
    its entirety contained within <code>cleverbug-alpha/</code> of this website. 
    <br>
    To view the code on GitHub, visit this link: <a href="https://github.com/Ravbug/ravbug.github.io/tree/master/cleverbug-alpha">GitHub</a>
    
    <br><br>The code 
    is a mess and poorly documented. I will attempt to break it down below.
    <hr>
    <br>
    This version of cleverbug was split into three parts. One part ran serverside, while the 
    other ran clientside, and the third part was a Google Spreadsheet. Yes, I used Google Sheets 
    as a free SQL database. 
    <br><br>

    <h3>Client-side code</h3>
    The way users interacted with the bot was through a webpage. The webpage presented the user 
    a simple interface: a large text area for the session's chat history, a text field for typing
    messages to the bot, and buttons to send the message and toggle the settings. In the settings 
    menu were two text fields for changing your's or the bot's display name. A "think for me" button 
    adorned the info box alongside the settings button. 

    <br><br>
    When the user pressed enter or clicked the say button, the responder engine executed. It actually 
    ran the responder clientside. The responder queried the google spreadsheet recursively with different 
    a different SELECT call until it got a satisfactory answer. It would then add the message to the chat history. 
    The client did not stop the user from sending messages before it had finished responding, making spam possible.

    <br><br>
    Think for me was nothing special. It simply called the responder with an empty string, effectively
    guarenteeing the base case of a random answer. It then placed that answer inside the user's say field.

    <br><br>The user posting a message to the chat also triggered the data collection, or "learning," aspect 
    of this version. It queried my server with a set of URL arguments containg what the user wrote and other information.
    This was how the bot learned. It gathered sentences from the users that interacted with it and added 
    them to the repertoire of phrases it could use. It did not generate unique phrases. 

    <br><br>
    You can see the original, working client running <a href="../"><b>here.</b></a>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Server-side code</h3>

    The server-side code was responsible for the learning aspect of the bot.
    I wrote the serverside in php and the clientside in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The server-side code 
    has been deactivated, but is preserved here.

    There are two versions of the serverside code preserved here. Version one was hard coded, 
    save for the client-secret file needed for Google Sheets authentication. Version two
    loaded a file named <code>cleverbug_badwords.txt</code> which contained a comma-separated
    list of tokens. I moved the bad word detection to a separate file so that I could easily
    add new tokens without fear of accidentally breaking the php code. 

    <br><br>
    When the server recieved a request from the client, it first checked the body for blacklisted
    words as described by <code>cleverbug_badwords.txt</code>. If a bad word was found, the server rejected
    the request. This step helped prevent (and worked surprisingly well) the bot from learning
    racist or offensive phrases. 

    <br><br>
    If the code did not find a bad word (and it checked for variations), then it proceeded to the 
    next step of adding it to the database. Here, it initialized the Google Spreadsheet API library
    for php (verison 2.2.0) and authenticated using the credentials described in <code>client_secret.json</code>.
    <br><br>
    After authentication, it called the Spreadsheet API to add a row to the spreadsheet. The row, once added,
    was instantly available to the clients, enabling real-time learning. 

    <br><br>Two files, <code>cleverbot_up.php</code> and <code>cleverbot_respond.php</code> also exist. These
    files contained a single instruction which was to include a different php file. The clients called 
    these two files. The reason I did this was because I didn't know anything about web security and I stored my
    credentials in plain text, albeit outside of <code>public_html</code>. I believed at the time that by storing the php 
    files that did the actual work outside of <code>public_html</code>, I would prevent hackers from
    tricking my server into downloading the php code and seeing how it worked. Of course, web security
    doesn't actually work that way. 

    <br><br>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    I didn't want to delete this code, so I decided to make it public, not that this code is worth anything. 
    If you want to read it, go ahead. This code turned into a Discord bot with the same name, which you
    can invite to your server by visiting the working client (linked above) and using the link in the footer.
