                Map completely rewritten from the ground up!
                This version also works in Minecraft 1.14, but I recommend that you download the 1.14 version if you plan to play 1.14, since it contains 1.14-specific fixes.

    <h4>Important Notes</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            If players are unable to change settings, set <code>spawn_permission</code> in <code>server.properties</code> to 0.
        </li>
        <li>
            This map will probably not work on servers with plugins! Please use vanilla without datapacks to ensure the best results. I will not fix issues relating to plugin compatibility. Instead, report those to the plugin devs.
