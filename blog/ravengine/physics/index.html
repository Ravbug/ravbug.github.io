<h2>3: Physics Simulation</h2>

<p>
    I cannot realistically implement a custom physics engine, nor should I. In fact, even Unity and Unreal (until recently)
    use off-the-shelf physics engines. I decided to do the same.
</p>
<p>
    I want my engine to take advantage of modern hardware. To that end, I one main requirement for physics engines:
    <ol>
        <li>
            Multi-threaded evaluation (GPU if possible)
        </li>
    </ol>
    After looking around, I found Bullet and PhysX as my top choices that satisfied this requirement. However, while Bullet had multi-threaded evaluation in the past, 
    and an experimental OpenCL evaluator, both of those features were removed in recent versions for being unpredictable or 
    unstable. That left only PhysX, which provides multi-threaded simulation on all platforms and GPU-accelerated simulation on 
    Microsoft Windows on NVIDIA GPUs. Incidentally, both Unity and Unreal (prior to 4.26) use PhysX.
</p>
<p>
    While PhysX uses CMake to build, the way you do this is not documented. You have to set up variables 
    before you call <code>add_subdirectory</code> otherwise configure will fail. Code from my CMakeLists:
<pre><code class="cmake"># PhysX-specific CMake project setup
set(NV_USE_DEBUG_WINCRT ON CACHE BOOL "Use the debug version of the CRT")
set(PHYSX_ROOT_DIR ${DEPS_DIR}/physx/physx CACHE INTERNAL "")
set(PXSHARED_PATH ${PHYSX_ROOT_DIR}/../pxshared CACHE INTERNAL "")
set(PXSHARED_INSTALL_PREFIX ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX} CACHE INTERNAL "")
set(PX_PHYSX_ ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX} CACHE INTERNAL "")
set(CMAKEMODULES_VERSION "1.27" CACHE INTERNAL "")
set(CMAKEMODULES_PATH ${PHYSX_ROOT_DIR}/../externals/cmakemodules CACHE INTERNAL "")
set(PX_OUTPUT_LIB_DIR ${CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY} CACHE INTERNAL "")
set(PX_OUTPUT_BIN_DIR ${CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY} CACHE INTERNAL "")
set(PX_GENERATE_STATIC_LIBRARIES ON CACHE INTERNAL "")
#set(PX_FLOAT_POINT_PRECISE_MATH OFF)
if (WIN32)
    set(TARGET_BUILD_PLATFORM "windows" CACHE INTERNAL "")
    set(PLATFORM "Windows")
elseif(APPLE)
    set(TARGET_BUILD_PLATFORM "mac" CACHE INTERNAL "")
    set(PLATFORM "macOS")
elseif(LINUX)
    set(TARGET_BUILD_PLATFORM "linux" CACHE INTERNAL "")
    set(CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE "x86_64-linux-gnu" CACHE INTERNAL "")
    set(PLATFORM "Linux")
    #set(CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE "aarch64-linux-gnu" CACHE INTERNAL "")
endif()

# Call into PhysX's CMake scripts
add_subdirectory("${PHYSX_ROOT_DIR}/compiler/public")
</code></pre>
    <blockquote>What a mess!</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
    Once I had PhysX compiling, I needed to integrate it into my engine. Because I wanted physics to be intuitive, I did not want
    a solution like Unity's where if you have a rigid body, you have to call separate RigidBody methods to correctly
    reposition a physics body. Instead, simply setting the transform component's position should automatically update the rigid body's 
    position if the object is a physics body. But how to integrate this as cleanly as possible? ECS to the rescue!
</p>
<p>
    I created two Systems: <code>PhysicsLinkSystemRead</code> and <code>PhysicsLinkSystemWrite</code>, which run at the beginning and end of a tick, respectively. 
    Each does what its name suggests - the former reads the transform values in PhysX and updates the Transform with those values, and the latter reads the transform's values
    and updates the underlying PhysX transform. Each performs appropriate locking within PhysX. In addition, there is no extra code required
    for the client programmers - adding a Physics body component will automatically turn that object into one. Duck typing at its best. Now there is only one way
    to update an object's position, and it just works, regardless of the object's attachment to the physics system.
</p>
<p>
    This method has additional benefits. For example, I am not tied to PhysX, I can swap this out for any physics engine. In fact, I originally designed
    the System pairs with the Bullet Physics library in mind instead of PhysX. PhysX was essentially a drop-in replacement.
</p>
<p>
    After that I simply needed to wrap PhysX's calls. This is currently an ongoing process, and since PhysX provides so many features, I am only wrapping
    the ones that I currently need. Over time, I hope to have complete coverage.
