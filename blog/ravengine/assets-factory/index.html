<h2>8: Assets and Factories</h2>
<script src="../date.js" date="10/14/2020"></script>

<p>
    Loading meshes, textures, and shaders can be computationally expensive, especially on slower hardware. The engine 
    should avoid doing expensive work and cache wherever possible. However, the typical way of doing this involves 
    rigid factory functions, but I want to avoid that as much as possible because it breaks OOP. Requiring the 
    client programmers to manage all assets manually in a thread-safe way would lead to a lot of duplicated code or additional 
    boilerplate, which is undesirable. 
</p>
<p>
    <h3>Variadic templates to the rescue</h3>
    My compromise is a variadic-template manager factory cache that calls constructors. Here is the material variant, shown below:
<pre><code class="cpp">/**
    Helper to get a material by type. If one is not allocated, it will be created. Supports constructors via parameter pack
    @param args arguments to pass to material constructor if needed
    */
template&lt;typename T, typename ... A&gt;
static Ref&lt;T&gt; AccessMaterialOfType(A ... args){
    Ref&lt;T&gt; mat;
    mtx.lock();
    std::type_index t(typeid(T));
    if (materials.find(t) != materials.end()){
        mat = materials.at(t);
    }
    else{
        mat = new T(args...);
        materials.insert(std::make_pair(t,mat));
    }
    mtx.unlock();
    return mat;
}</code></pre>
    And sample usage:
    <pre><code class="cpp">int a =3, b = 5, c = 4;
auto cachedMat = Material::Manager::AccessMaterialOfType&lt;CustomMaterial&gt;(a, b, c);</code></pre>
    The Material::Manager class maintains a thread-safe cache. The AccessMaterialOfType method checks the cache,
    and if the material of that type is already loaded, it simply returns the cached material. Otherwise, the appropriate constructor 
    is selected via the variadic arguments, and a reference to that is stored in the cache and returned. 
</p>
<p>
    For the material system, checking by type alone is enough most of the time because generally only one instance of a particular 
    type of material needs to be loaded, because draw settings are stored in MaterialInstances, which reference a single material. 
    However, there are undoubtedly situations where multiple materials of the same type need to be loaded. 
    In that case, the client programmer does not need to use the factory function at all and instead construct their Material normally and manage it themselves.
    <pre><code class="cpp">Ref&lt;CustomMaterial&gt; mat(new CustomMaterial(a,b,c));</code></pre>
    In the cases where the default behavior is appropriate, Material::Manager provides this thread-safe cached factory that does not break OOP. 
</p>
<p>
    <h3>Leveraging reference counting</h3>
    Because all materials and mesh assets are reference counted, once a material is in the cache, it will not be deallocated unless 
    it is first removed from the cache. The Material Manager provides a thread-safe method to achieve this. But since assets are reference 
    counted, it is safe to remove a material or mesh asset from the cache while it is still in use. It will remain allocated until 
    its last user is deallocated, then its reference count will reach 0 and it will be deallocated. This is useful in dynamic-loading maps 
    where you know that a material is not needed anymore but do not know what order the assets will be deallocated in. The system takes care of it for you.
