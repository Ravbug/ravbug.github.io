    <p>
        In the past, I manually created IDE projects for each platform that I supported. Typically, I supported macOS and Windows, with some Linux support. 
        This practice was fine for small projects, like my Minecraft Sounds Extractor, but with a project the size of a game engine, it could not work.
        In general, this practice has a few main issues:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            IDE configuration must be manually repeated for every supported platform
        </li>
        <li>
            It forces the client programmers to use a specific toolchain (Xcode on Mac, Visual Studio on Windows) rather than use what they are comfortable with
        </li>
        <li>
            Each build system has a different way of doing things, all of which must be learned
        </li>
        <li>
            Client programmers must deal with all of the aforementioned problems
        </li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        Since I am writing my engine in C++, I have access to the wealth of open source C++ libraries that have been developed over the lifetime of C++.
        Indeed, if you can think it, there is a C++ library for it. Mostly. There may be a library, but not the way that you want. For each task I evaluated multiple libraries 
        and weighed their ease of use against the time cost for implementing a custom solution.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ultimately I decided to provide a unified interface which may or may not call into a library underneath. Ideally, a client programmer should not need
        to know or care that a library is in use, and this also leaves me free to switch out underlying libraries as long as I keep the API's behavior the same.
    </p>
    <p>
        Scratching the surface of the libraries I researched for this project:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Physics:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Bullet
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        PhysX
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Windowing & Input
                <ul>
                    <li>

        As I was researching libraries to use for my project, I noticed that the vast majority used as system named CMake to generate an IDE project of your choice. I didn't know what it was,
        and used it to generate the projects so that I could link them all together manually. However, I found that IDEs weren't designed to do this and so I ran into many strange errors when 
        trying to compile my engine, many of which only happened sometimes and were not repeatable.  
    </p>
    <p>
        I decided that I would learn how to use CMake, and make it the main build system of my engine. This was probably the best decision I have made in the making of this project. Yes, CMake 
        is not perfect and can be obtuse at times, but all of the aforementioned main issues disappeared. In addition, I can automate aspects of the build process of my 
        engine in ways that would be difficult to do in a cross-platform way. 
    </p>
    <h3>Automating shader compilation</h3>
    <p>
        CMake allows the creation of custom targets. With these targets, one can execute command line calls. I leverage this to compile shaders and pack resources all
        completely automatically. To compile shaders, first the client programmer must instruct the engine where their shaders directory is, using a macro exposed by the engine's 
        CMakeLists.txt. 
        <pre><code class="cmake">compile_shader_dir("YourRavEngineGame" "src/shaders")</code></pre>
        CMake then knows to execute my shader compiler on the files in that directory as a pre-build action. Only files that have changed are evaluated. 
        Client programmers create shader descriptor JSON files which tell the shader compiler what shader source files to use in the compilation. Shown below is an example of a shader descriptor:
        <pre><code class="json">{
    "varying" : "varying.def.sc",
    "stages":[
        {
            "file":"vs_cubes.sc",
            "stage":"vertex"
        },
        {
            "file":"fs_cubes.sc",
            "stage":"fragment"
        }
    ]
} </code></pre>
        Of course, I did not write a shader compiler. Instead, I call into the BGFX shader compiler and pass it the correct arguments, based on the current target platform. 
        This process is hidden from the client programmer, making the engine easier to use. To the client programmer, there is only one compilation step. 
    </p>
    
    <h3>Packing resources</h3>
    <p>
        To consolidate resources for easier loading within the engine across platforms, RavEngine packs all game assets into a single .zip file, which it then mounts like a disk at runtime.
        It builds this asset package automatically in a similar method to the shader compilation step. Fist, the programmer instructs the engine where to find assets such as meshes by invoking
        the proper macro:
    <pre><code class="cmake">file(GLOB meshes "assets/meshes/*.obj")
add_meshes("YourRavEngineGame" "${meshes}")</code></pre>
        These macros simply copy those resources to a staging directory in the build directory if they have changed. After the programmer names all assets to include, they must then instruct the 
        toolchain to pack them all together. To do this, simply invoke another macro:
        <pre><code class="cmake">pack_resources("YourRavEngineGame")</code></pre>
        This instructs CMake to execute a second tool I wrote which takes all the assets and creates a compressed Zip file. On Mac, this zip file is placed inside the app bundle, and on Linux, I plan 
        to include it inside the .appimage. 
    </p>
