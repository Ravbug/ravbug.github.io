        To avoid breaking stuff before the showcase I limited my development this week, but I made some progress.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Fixed a potential overflow issue in the Input Manager (size_t to uint32_t)
            </li>
            <li>
                Port unit tests from the old ECS repository into mainline 
            </li>
            <li>
                Switch to single-precision float mode by default to improve performance
            </li>
            <li>
                Make some changes to the lighting pipeline in preparation for point lights -- the stride sizes
                were incorrect for point light data. The shader will also need to change because it is making the 
                invalid assumption that the vertex-to-light vector is the same for every vertex, this is only 
                true for directional lights. 
            </li>
            <li>
                I got ahold of an iPhone 6 (an 8 year old device!) to test low end hardware. Unfortunately, it can't 
                run anything newer than iOS 12, and std::filesystem was added in iOS 13. So I am working on 
                making a wrapper between boost::filesystem and std::filesystem for compatibility against old operating 
                systems. 
            </li>
        </ul>
