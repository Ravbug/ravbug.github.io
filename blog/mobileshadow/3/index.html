        <b>Volume Generation</b>
    <p>
        This week, I focused on the first big part of the algorithm - determining which pixels in the final frame are in shadow. 
        Based on the research that I did prior, I found that many implementations worked around the issues of generating volume silhouettes 
        by simply not doing that at all, and instead considering each triangle individually in a vacuum. I decided to implement something
        similar, but with a twist.
    </p>
    <p>
        Instead of building a hierarchical depth map like multiple existing implementations do, I decided to opt for potentially the na√Øvest
        approach possible, just to see what performance is like. I made a triangular prism mesh which I then copy to each triangle 
        rendered in the previous pass, and then transform it so that its base face covers that triangle. Then the cap on the opposite side
        is extended to form that triangle's volume mesh. 
    </p>
    <p>
        It took a few attempts to get that to work:<br>

    </p>
    <p>
        Then I attached the prisms to the triangles, offsetting first by the normal vector to see if everything was working, and then extending along the light vector:

        </figure>
    </p>
    <p>
        Once those were resolved, it kind of worked:

            <figcaption>The shadows are trying to exist, but they are not quite succeeding</figcaption>
        </figure>
    </p>
    <p>
        I ran into two large problems with this approach. Geometry is cheap, as I thought, but what is not cheap is the immense amount of overdraw this 
        solution causes. I implemented Carmack's Reverse to determine if a region was in shadow, but found that for dense volume counts this 
        caused high GPU usage and low framerates, the exact opposite of what I was going for! The stencil buffer, being 1 byte per slot, also caused 
        problems during wraparound though this could be a bug in my implementation. I was able to reduce the overdraw problem significantly by
        only calculating volumes for triangles that were oriented towards the light, but it was still slower than I wanted since Carmack's Reverse still requires a lot of 
        wasted calculations. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Next week, I will investigate a different method of determining if a pixel is in shadow. Because I know the number of vertices 
        in each volume, and I know that they are convex (because they are triangular prisms), it should be possible to easily determine
        if the current instance encompasses the pixel depth-wise. Once one is found, I could then write a depth or stencil value which would
        cause all future fragment invocations at that location to early-out, greatly reducing the amount of overdraw. Hopefully this will resolve the errors and make it faster.
