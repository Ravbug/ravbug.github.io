        This week I tackled bugs in my system. The first problem I addressed is the incorrect shadowing on triangles that are not facing 
        the light. Because triangles that are not facing the light are blocking themselves, their color had already been calculated
        by the primary light pass in an earlier stage. Therefore, the system can skip calculating shadows for these triangles.

                By reading from the normal texture calculated in the first deferred stage, this artifact can be removed. I experimented with 
                the min nDotL value to determine the best cutoff to use.

                The shading on the objects in the physics demo is also now mostly correct.

        The next issue that I decided to tackle was the behavior where the shadow system would break down depending on the behavior of the camera.
        It turns out this bug was actually two separate problems. The first was if the camera intersected a volume, no fragments would get generated for it,
        resulting in gaps. However, a second issue causes the system to completely freak out if the camera is simply oriented in a certain way, as shown
        below:
        <figure>
            <video controls class="responsiveImg" src="orientation.webm"></video>
            <figcaption>
                Yikes! What's happening??
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        The intersection problem is more complicated to solve than I initially thought. After some experimentation, I determined that pinning the volume vertices to the near-clip plane 
        if they end up behind the camera will not work. My current idea for fixing this involves doing a second pass of the volumes but rendering them inside-out and 
        inverting the plane tests. However, I will need to figure out a way to do this without making the overdraw problem even worse. 
    </p>

        I had planned for the above issue to be fixed this week, but due to its newly discovered complexity, I have the camera-orientation bug slated for fix next week, as well as 
        coming up with the inside-out approach.
