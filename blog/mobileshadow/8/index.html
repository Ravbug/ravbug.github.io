        I dug deeper into the bgfx crash on Metal caused by attempting to execute a vertex shader that writes to compute buffers.
        It turns out that this behavior was not supported in Metal until version 2.1 (2.2 for writing to textures). SPIRV-Cross, 
        the library BGFX's shader compiler tool uses to automatically generate shaders from a single source file for all supported
        backends, is aware of this limitation and handles it appropriately. However, bgfx's shader compiler did not set the Metal 
        shader version when configuring the compile, and so SPIRV-Cross assumed Metal 1.0. This caused SPIRV-Cross to detect that
        the shader was writing to a compute buffer and disable rasterizaton, which meant changing the generated vertex shader's 
        return type to <code>void</code>. Because the shader had no output, trying to link it with a fragment program would cause 
        Metal to error and bgfx to crash. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I was able to fix the issue by hardcoding the Metal shader target version to 2.1 in Shaderc's source code. I plan to 
        submit a proper PR to bgfx which adds the ability to specify the metal version via a command-line flag.
    </p>

       Now that I had Metal working, I tested the engine on my iPad which has an A12X processor. It has interesting performance
       characteristics compared to the desktop version.

        The animation sample performed significantly better on the iPad compared to my laptop in my tests, and never dropped below ~120
        fps (the refresh rate of the display), whereas my laptop, which has a significantly faster GPU, would sometimes stutter and
        drop frames, sometimes into the 30fps range. However, on the rigid bodies demo, the iPad performed significantly worse 
        when compared to my laptop. I believe these behaviors are symptoms of the large amounts of overdraw and how 
        a tile-based GPU resolves them when compared to a desktop GPU.

        I also fixed another bug. The noise in the shadows was indeed caused by slight gaps in the projected triangles. By expanding the
        triangles slightly when projecting them, they now overlap on those borders, reducing the noise to almost zero.
        <figure>

            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        There are still cases where a very small amount of noise is possible, but I think when I implement edge feathering this 
        issue should be made so minimal it may no longer matter.
    </p>

        I didn't fix the shadow-freakout bug this week, but I have gotten closer. It appears that the way I am calculating 
        the normal vectors for the triangles on the prism creates faulty results. 
        <figure>
            <img src="correct.png" class="responsiveImg">
            <figcaption>
                The signs of the z-component of the normal vectors cannot all be the same. In camera orientation A,
                the signs are as expected.

            <figcaption>
                However, when moving to camera orientation B, they are all positive, which indicates that my method of calculating 
                the screen-space normal vectors does not work.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        The later stages of the pipeline are then fed bad data because of this error, leading to the broken shadows. Fixing this 
        calculation should resolve the issue, and I have that slated for next week.
