        Why don't you see for yourself :)

                We have shadows! But there are still some issues to resolve

        After weeks and two separate GPU debuggers later, the shadow algorithm correctly generates pixel-perfect shadows given a static or animated mesh! However, there are a few important issues to resolve:
        <ol>
            <li>
                When the camera enters a shadow volume, that volume stops working (see in the video).
            </li>
            <li>
                The implementation can only handle 1 light (this should be fairly trivial to fix)
            </li>
            <li>
                It wastes cycles in the vertex shader doing unnecessary repeated work
            </li>
            <li>
                The overlapping volumes create a lot of overdraw which quickly becomes a performance bottleneck as the polygon count increases
            </li>
            <li>
                Soft edges?
            </li>
        </ol>
        The reason issue #1 happens is because the engine only calculates fragments for the front side of the volumes. If the camera goes inside a volume, this stops happening.
        It may be possible to cap the positioning of the volume vertices such that the caps never end up behind the camera, thus ensuring a volume always has fragment invocations.

                I spent many hours staring at graphs of planes. A change of one (1) character caused my solution to go from completely broken to the video above.

        </figure>
        <p>
            I intend to address issues #2 and #3 through a combination of compute shaders (to reduce repeated work in the vertex shader) and multidraw-indirect (for multiple source lights). Issue #4 is perhaps the most
            complex issue. While the overdraw problem is significantly better than brute-forcing with Carmack's Reverse, it remains the major source of performance problems.
            If I can find a way to make all future fragment invocations early-out once a shadowed pixel is found for a given light, I could greatly reduce the amount of overdraw.
        </p>

                Lighter colors indicate more overdraw. Yikes!

        I plan to focus on issue #1 for next week. Fixing it would mean that for opaque shadows the system works, and my tasks become focused on optimization rather than functionality.
