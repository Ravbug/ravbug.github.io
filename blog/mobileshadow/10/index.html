        In the previous post I described my rewrite of the lighting stage of the pipeline due to 
        critical flaws in its original design, and how during that week I did not have a working 
        renderer. However, this week that is not the case :)

    <p>
        The lights are now properly blocked by the shadows, meaning that a light calculation is skipped if the engine determines
        the pixel cannot "see" that light, so the proper shadowed-side colors appear.
    </p>

    </p>
        It took some experimentation to get to this point, and I also made some important optimizations along the way.
        The first issue I noticed was that the shadow system was calculating fragments even though there was no way that 
        those fragments could appear in the final frame because they were behind objects. This led to some strange results:

            The shader assumes that only pixels that could possibly be shadows were running, resulting in overshadowing the scene
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
        Despite rewriting the shader to remove all calls to <code>discard</code>, since those disable the early fragment tests, it was 
        still producing the exact same result. It turns out that writing to a compute buffer in fragment shader also disables early fragment 
        discard. Fortunately, there is an override for this, via the <code>[earlydepthstencil]</code> HLSL attribute.
    </p>

        I enabled it and it did absolutely nothing. I discovered that this was a bug in bgfx - it was not enabling the feature on Metal or Vulkan 
        even though both APIs support this feature. I fixed it (it was a very simple fix) and PR'ed it into bgfx, which they merged.
    </p>
    <p>
        With the feature enabled, I got a large speedup because only fragments that were in-view were now getting calculations. However, even with 
        this optimization, shadow calculations are still taking a worrying amount of time:

        </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
        For reference, the ambient light pass, which does no shadow calculations, takes so little time it doesn't even appear on the graph.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also noticed a bizarre result when running the device on my iPad:
        <figure>

                Some tile GPU shenanigans?
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        The iPad still maintains significantly superior performance to my laptop on the animation demo.
    </p>
    <p>
        Despite all the bugs that still exist in this implementation, I believe I have achieved what I intended to during this process - I demonstrated 
        that rendering shadows for opaque casters is possible with this method, that it demonstrates measurable improvements over depth mapping 
        and ray tracing in some aspects relevant to realtime rendering, and it works well on mobile. The process forward, I expect, is mostly 
        fixing bugs and making tweaks to improve the quality and performance.
