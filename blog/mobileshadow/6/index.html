    <p>
        This week I didn't write any code due to it being a heavy exams week. I scheduled two meetings, one with a professor at this university and 
        an industry professional at a local game development company.
    </p>
    <p>
        Notes from their meetings:
        <ul>
            <li>Common issues encountered implementing Cascade shadows
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Cascade shadow map uses a lot of VRAM 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Managing where details should and should not appear - Common issue: standing on a hilltop and casting a shadow into the valley below, that shadow might get eaten by the lower cascade
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Blending between shadow cascades
                    </li>
                </ul>
                My algorithm addresses all of these problems, but no solution is perfect and currently my solution would lose an implementer transparent casters and soft shadows. So, I need to work on solutions for both of those issues.
            </li>
            <li>
                Things to try:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Sometimes the compute pipeline is “free” depending on the architecture if it's not in use during another operation
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Radeon RGP (or its new name?) gives the best timing information as of writing
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Noise in shadows → expand each volume a small amount so that they overlap and eliminate the issues of triangle edges
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        “Wavy edge” on the sphere → check rasterizing linear surface on nonlinear edge. Also could skip the calculation if the cap (bounded, not just planes) is too close to the front face. Use normal 
                        information from earlier deferred stage to determine if a self shadow calculation is necessary, for triangles facing away from the light no self shadow calculation is necessary. Are shadow calculations 
                        necessary in general if the triangle is not facing the light? Need to test this. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Radiosity Maps - A way to have transparency by encoding information about each object in textures and then doing lookups in the shader. May be a way to implement transparent casters.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        I have rescheduled the todo task from last week to this week to get caught up again.
